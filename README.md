# Stock Analysis: VBA Code Refactoring & Measuring Performance 
---

## Overview of Project

Intially this project was about client Steve, who was evaluating green energy stocks for his parents. The initial analysis of the DQ stock they had chosen indicated that it had lost value and wasn't the best investment. Following that discovery, Steve asked for help to design a program that could look at multiple stocks simultaneously and compare changes in their stock values in a sweet little table layout.

### Purpose

When writing a program to compare multiple stocks and their total value increases and decreases, and thinking of how the program could "scale" even further in the future, a few things seemed relevant: visual clarity, variety and timing.Adding buttons and visual formatting to the program made it more easily understood at a glance, and the program was improved with the ability to access multiple spreadsheets from multiple sock years. The final refactoring of the program involves invesitgate timing.

As the data increases, saving time on the computation becomes useful - and interesting. For this final re-write of the program, we are testing the speed of two different code methods of finding the begining and ending price comparisons and totaling them to see which is more efficient.

## Analysis and Challenges

The first method used was to

Below are the improved timings with our re-factored code:
